# Gears N' Genes RAG Playground (Local SLM + Qdrant Edition)

## 🧩 Overview

This is a self-contained Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) playground powered by:

- **Local embedding models** (`intfloat/e5-small-v2`)
- **Qdrant** for local vector search
- **Small Language Models (SLMs)** like `phi-4` running via `llama-cpp`
- **Flask** for a lightweight API and interactive web UI

Users can upload documents (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT) or images (JPG, PNG), organize them into topics, embed their contents for semantic search, and query them through a local model with markdown-rich responses and image rendering.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Or manually ensure these are installed:

* flask
* qdrant-client
* sentence-transformers
* llama-cpp-python
* python-pptx, python-docx, PyPDF2

---

### 2. Setup Qdrant (Local Vector DB)

This project uses a **local Qdrant instance** for storing and querying vector embeddings.

You can launch Qdrant via Docker:

```bash
docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 qdrant/qdrant
```
This command:

 * Maps Qdrant's HTTP API to your local port `6333`
 * Uses the REST port `6334`
 * Persists vector data in the volume `qdrant_data`
 * Uses the official image from Docker Hub

Ensure Qdrant is running before launching the Flask app.

---

### 3. Prepare `.env` File

```env
UPLOAD_ROOT=uploads
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key  # Used ONLY for GPT-4 alt-text generation
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-api-key # OPTIONAL, only if you choose not to use qdrant
```

> ✅ OpenAI is only used to generate image descriptions for embedded figures in PDF files where no alt-text can be accessed. The rest of the pipeline is fully local.

---

### 4. Launch the App

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit the app at: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## 🧠 Local Model Notes

By default, the app loads:

```python
from llama_cpp import Llama
#... code imports and model configs defined above
MODEL_NAME = "Mistral-7B-DPO"
MODEL_CONFIG = model_configs.get(MODEL_NAME)

REPO_ID = MODEL_CONFIG.get("repo_id")
MODEL_FILENAME = MODEL_CONFIG.get("filename")
N_CTX = MODEL_CONFIG.get("n_ctx")
#...
#Define the llm based on the config details
llm = Llama.from_pretrained(
    repo_id=REPO_ID,
    filename=MODEL_FILENAME,
    n_ctx=N_CTX
)
```

To use another GGUF-compatible model, just change the `repo_id` and `filename` in `rag_slm.py`.

---

## Image Citation Format

Image files must include alt-text in one of three ways:
* Images that come with alt-text in the documents themselves (DOCX/PPTX)
* Auto-generated via GPT-4-turbo (PDF-upload pipeline)
* Manually entered for individual JPG/PNG uploads

They are embedded and rendered in markdown as:

```markdown
![Image description](uploads/topic_dir/your_image.jpg)
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Instructions (Optional)

To deploy the app via Docker:

```bash
docker build -t gnrag .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name rag-local gnrag
```

Then access the app at: `http://<your.local.ip>:5000`

**Warning:** If you are using the qdrant vector database, then the container you run WILL NOT WORK on account of the issue that the qdrant image won't be hosted on your device. This is under development at the moment.
---

## 🧪 Testing CLI (Optional)

To test queries in terminal using the local model:

```bash
python rag_slm.py
```
